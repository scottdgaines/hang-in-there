Mod 1, Project 2 (Paired)

## Overview

We all need a little pick-me-up every now and then. Now you can generate an inspirational poster, or create one of your own!

This app was built by Derek Cooper and Scott Gaines from a previously-set comp and data model provided by the Turing School of Software and Design. It's architecture includes:

* index.html
* styles.css
* an src directory containing:
  * main.js
  * poster.js
* an assets folder containing all poster images
